# PHP Site Framework

1. Copy this folder to your project root.
2. Edit package.json with your project name and description.
3. Open Terminal and run "npm install -dd" from your project folder to install package dependencies. This can take a while.
4. Create something awesome!

## Important
When you upload your project, make sure you login to the root folder in the FTP account, your htdocs/public_html folder will be public facing and src should always be uploaded outside of the public folder.

**Do not upload /node_modules.**

### To do

- Add composer support for PHP dependency management.
- Add Bower support for front-end dependency management.
